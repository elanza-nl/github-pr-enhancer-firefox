**Privacy Policy**

This Firefox extension ("the Extension") does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information or user data to any external servers.

The Extension requires a GitHub personal access token to retrieve reviewer information through the GitHub API.

The token is stored **only locally** on the user's device using Firefox's local storage API and is **never transmitted** to any third-party service.

All operations are executed within the user's browser, and no external data collection occurs.

If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the developer.
